Getting started
- Quick-start overview
  - Install the tool from the Releases page. The page is at https://github.com/ArekM27/ContentExtractor/releases. Download the installer or binary that matches your OS, then run it. The file to download is the installer or binary on that page, so pick the one that matches your platform and architecture, download it, and execute it.
  - After installation, run the command-line interface to verify the installation. For example, run content-extractor --version to confirm the binary is accessible and healthy.
  - Provide a sample input to test. Start with a simple text file and a small set of patterns. Observe the outputs and adjust configurations as needed.
- Long-form setup
  - Install prerequisites: ensure you have a supported runtime and any required system libraries as described in the installation guide.
  - Configure a working directory and permissions. The engine reads from input directories, writes to output directories, and stores temporary data in a workspace.
  - Prepare an initial configuration. You can use a default configuration to start. Then refine your rules, patterns, and analyzers to suit your data domain.
  - Run a first pass. Use a curated dataset to exercise the pipeline end-to-end. Review the resulting reports and refine thresholds and classifiers as needed.
  - Iterate and automate. Integrate the tool into your data workflows using the CLI or the API. Add scheduled tasks or event-driven triggers to keep insights up to date.

Configuration guidelines
- Pattern definitions
  - Patterns describe the signals you want to detect. They can be simple keywords or complex regular expressions.
  - Use clear, domain-specific terms to reduce ambiguity.
- Scoring and thresholds
  - Each detected pattern gets a confidence score. Set thresholds to balance precision and recall for your data.
- Preprocessing options
  - Choose language models, OCR configurations, and normalization rules that fit your data quality.
- Output preferences
  - Decide which outputs you want and in what format. Configure dashboards or exports to align with your reporting needs.

Performance tuning and best practices
- Use smaller, curated datasets for development and testing. This speeds up iterations.
- Start with sensible defaults and gradually adjust thresholds as you analyze more data.
- Monitor resource usage during heavy runs. If you observe memory pressure, consider batching or reducing parallelism.
- Maintain clean input data. Remove duplicate or corrupted records before running large analyses.

Security best practices
- Run sensitive analyses on secure machines or isolated environments.
- Limit access to configuration files and results directories.
- Keep the software up to date with the latest releases to mitigate known issues.
